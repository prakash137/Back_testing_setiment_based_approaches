    "1. **Data Preparation**: Collect historical adjusted close prices for the selected tickers using the `yfinance` library and calculate daily returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Portfolio Construction**: Construct portfolios based on different weighting strategies (equal weights, sentiment-enhanced weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtest Simulation**:\n",
    "    - `portfolio_performance(weights, returns)`: Calculate the annualized return and volatility of the portfolio.\n",
    "    - `max_drawdown(returns)`: Calculate the maximum drawdown of the portfolio.\n",
    "    - `backtest_portfolio(weights, returns)`: Simulate the portfolio's performance over the historical period, computing cumulative returns, annualized return, volatility, and maximum drawdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "    - Compare annualized returns, annualized volatility, and maximum drawdown between the equal weights portfolio and the sentiment-enhanced portfolio.\n",
    "    - Plot cumulative returns for visual comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save the content in a Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `Backtesting_Portfolio_Optimization.ipynb`).\n",
    "2. Run the notebook step-by-step to see the performance of both the traditional and sentiment-enhanced portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rolling Window Analysis**: Implement a rolling window backtesting approach to dynamically adjust portfolio weights based on sentiment scores over time.\n",
    "- **Transaction Costs**: Include transaction costs to make the backtesting more realistic.\n",
    "- **Rebalancing Strategy**: Test different rebalancing frequencies (monthly, quarterly, etc.) to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy provides a robust framework for backtesting and comparing sentiment-enhanced portfolios against traditional methods."
